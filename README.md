The software is here to help you size the bets in a _focused portfolio with a long-term time horizon_. It uses
mathematics to formulate and solve a problem that allocates capital by maximizing long-term growth of assets while
avoiding leverage and limiting the risk of permanent loss of capital. 

### Documentation

The documentation consists of four parts:
1. [Tutorials](/TUTORIALS.md),
2. [How-To Guides](/HOW-TO.md),
3. [Reference Guide](/REFERENCE.md),
4. [Paper](/doc/paper.pdf).

The best place to start is to read the [Reference Guide](/REFERENCE.md) to get a feeling about the thinking
behind the project, and the overview of its structure. [How-To Guides](/HOW-TO.md) have instructions on how to install
the software locally, while [Tutorials](/TUTORIALS.md) contain examples on how to run and use the software.
[Paper](/doc/paper.pdf) contains details on mathematics and numerics behind the software, along with some basic
validation and examples similar to those that can be found in the repository.
