## Charlie

The software is named after Charlie Munger, and is here to help you out in portfolio allocation for a focused, value
investing approach. **This software can give you advice, but it cannot give you conduct**. If you find yourself using
this tool very often by changing inputs to match your preconceived expectations, then you're probably on the wrong path.

### Documentation

The documentation consists of four parts:
1. [Tutorials](/TUTORIALS.md),
2. [How-To Guides](/HOW-TO.md)
3. [Reference Guide](/REFERENCE.md)
4. [Paper](/doc/paper.pdf)

In our view, the best place to start is to read the [Reference Guide](/REFERENCE.md) to get a feeling about our thinking
behind the project, and the overview of its structure. [How-To Guides](/HOW-TO.md) have instructions on how to install
the software locally, while [Tutorials](/TUTORIALS.md) contain examples on how to run and use the software.
[Paper](/doc/paper.pdf) contains details on mathematics and numerics behind the software, along with some basic
validation and examples similar to those that can be found in the repository.
