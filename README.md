Tools to help with capital allocation process.

## Investment process

This software is rather simple and it really serves two purposes, both of them related to capital allocation process:
1. Keep us honest when deciding on the amount of capital to allocate to a particular investment,
2. Automate the process, freeing up time for more useful things.

Therefore, I firmly believe that using (and even writing) this software should take less than 0.1% of the time when
making investment decisions. In other words, a vast majority of time should be spent on defining what goes into the
software as an input.
